# Loan_Default

Commercial banks play a pivotal role in the global financial ecosystem by serving as intermediaries between borrowers and depositors. One of the primary functions of a Bank is to accurately evaluate risk when extending loans to individuals. Modern banks employ statistical learning models to reduce the likelihood of loaning to potential defaulters. Traditionally, credit underwriting involved a manual financial statement analysis and was fraught with limitations. However statistical learning has revolutionized the way people are evaluated for loans. As of September 2023, the profit margin of commercial banks in the U.S. was approximately 26.9%. To ensure these positive profit margins aswell as preventing solvency, being able to predict loan default with accuracy is in the best interest of any loan issuer.

The aim of this project is to predict whether or not a borrower will default on their loan.
